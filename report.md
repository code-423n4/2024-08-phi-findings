# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Phi smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit took place between August 22 â€” September 3, 2024.

# High Risk Findings (7)
## [[H-01] Signature replay in `signatureClaim` results in unauthorized claiming of rewards](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/254)
*Submitted by [kuprum](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/254), also found by [Evo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/99), [McToady](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/59), and [rbserver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/37)*

Loss of funds due to unauthorized and multiple claiming of art rewards: signature obtained from the Phi signer on one chain can be employed to claim NFT rewards on any other chain.

### Summary

Contract `PhiFactory` includes the function [`signatureClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L327-L346), which is intended for claiming art rewards using a signature obtained from the Phi signing authority. Unfortunately, the signature validation in this function is faulty, as it doesn't validate the chain id for which the signature has been issued:

```solidity
(uint256 expiresIn_, address minter_, address ref_, address verifier_, uint256 artId_,, bytes32 data_) =
    abi.decode(encodeData_, (uint256, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes32));

if (expiresIn_ <= block.timestamp) revert SignatureExpired();
if (_recoverSigner(keccak256(encodeData_), signature_) != phiSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();
```

Notice the fragment `uint256 artId_,, bytes32 data_`: in between of `artId` and `data_` there is the encoded `chainId`, which is ignored.

There is a correct path for signature claims, which goes via `PhiNFT1155` -> [`Claimable::signatureClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/abstract/Claimable.sol#L22-L44), which unpacks the supplied data, but submits to `PhiFactory::signatureClaim` the data with the chain id substituted with `block.chainid`. Unfortunately, `PhiFactory::signatureClaim` can be called directly, thus bypassing this crucial step. As a result, the signature obtained for one chain can be reused for multiple chains. As `PhiFactory` and art contracts on multiple chains are independent, the `artId` referring to some cheap artwork on one chain, may refer on another chain to a very valuable artwork; claiming this artwork without proper authorization leads to direct loss of funds. Here is the scenario:

1. An attacker observes that a valuable art piece exists on chain `A` with `artId`.
2. They find a chain `B` where such `artId` is not yet used, and create a bunch of arts till they reach this `artId`.
3. They correctly claim `artId` on chain `B`.
4. They reuse the obtained signature to claim the art piece with `artId` on chain `A`, thus effectively stealing it.

### Proof of Concept

Drop this test to [Claimable.t.sol](hhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/test/Claimable.t.sol#L172) and execute via `forge test --match-test Kuprum`:

```solidity
    function testKuprum_Claim_with_Signature_Replay() public {
        uint256 artId = 1;
        uint256 tokenId = 1;
        uint256 quantity = 1;

        // The signature is obtained on some other chain
        uint256 otherChainId = 99999;
        assertNotEq(block.chainid, otherChainId);

        // Prepare the signature
        bytes32 claimData = bytes32("1");
        bytes memory signData =
            abi.encode(expiresIn, participant, referrer, verifier, artId, otherChainId, claimData);
        bytes32 digest = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(keccak256(signData));
        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(claimSignerPrivateKey, digest);
        if (v != 27) s = s | bytes32(uint256(1) << 255);
        bytes memory signature = abi.encodePacked(r, s);

        // Claim from the factory with the signature obtained for another chain
        vm.warp(START_TIME + 1);
        vm.startPrank(participant, participant);
        IPhiFactory.MintArgs memory mintArgs = IPhiFactory.MintArgs(tokenId, quantity, "ART_ID_URL_STRING");
        phiFactory.signatureClaim{ value: phiFactory.getArtMintFee(artId, 1) }(signature, signData, mintArgs);

        // All balances on this chain are updated, despite invalid signature
        assertEq(IERC1155(phiFactory.getArtAddress(artId)).balanceOf(participant, 1), 1, "participant erc1155 balance");
        assertEq(curatorRewardsDistributor.balanceOf(1), CURATE_REWARD, "epoch fee");
        assertEq(verifier.balance, 1 ether, "verify fee");
        vm.startPrank(verifier);
        phiRewards.withdraw(verifier, VERIFY_REWARD);
        assertEq(verifier.balance, 1 ether + VERIFY_REWARD, "verify fee");
    }
```

### Tools Used

Foundry

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We recommend to apply in `PhiFactory::signatureClaim` the same approach as in `Claimable::signatureClaim`, i.e., to repack the signature data substituting the `chainId` with `block.chainid`.

## [[H-02] Signature replay in `createArt` allows to impersonate artist and steal royalties](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/70)
*Submitted by [kuprum](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/70), also found by [rscodes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/306), [petarP1998](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/303), [Tigerfrake](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/300), [joicygiore](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/265), [Jorgect](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/234), [MrValioBg](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/189), [OpaBatyo](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/170), [smaul](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/163), [willycode20](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/159), [McToady](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/143), [hail\_the\_lord](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/131), [0xNirix](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/124), [pep7siup](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/108), [enami\_el](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/95), [Sparrow](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/83), [rbserver](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/40), and [0xCiphky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/24)*

Loss of funds as anyone can frontrun the `createArt` transaction, reusing the original signature but supplying their own config. As a result, the artist, the royalties recipient, as well the the royalty BPS can be set arbitrarily, leading to stealing the royalties from the artist and achieving other impacts.

### Summary

Function [`PhiFactory::createArt()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L196-L213) doesn't limit the signature to either the specific submitter, nor does it include into the signed data the `CreateConfig` parameters; which in particular include the `artist`, the royalties `receiver`, as well as other parameters. Other impacts are possible but here is one specific scenario:

1. The legitimate party creates a valid signature, config, and submits the `createArt` transaction.
2. An attacker observes `createArt` transaction in the mempool, and frontruns it, reusing the signature, but with their own config where they are the royalties recipient.
3. Attacker's transaction succeeds, setting them as the royalties recipient.
4. The original transaction gets executed, and also succeeds, because [createERC1155Internal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L551-L568) succeeds both when a new `PhiNFT1155` contract is created, as well as when it exists already.
5. The legitimate user doesn't notice the difference: both `ArtContractCreated` and `NewArtCreated` events are emitted correctly (only `NewArtCreated` is emitted twice).

As a result, the attacker gets all rewards sent to the `PhiRewards` contract from `PhiNFT1155` when the legitimate party claims an NFT token (see [`PhiNFT1155::claimFromFactory()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol#L164-L190)).

Other possible impacts (a non-exclusive list):

- The attacker sets themselves as an `artist`, and gets the possibility to call the [`PhiNFT1155::updateRoyalties()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol#L195C14-L203) function, thus setting the `royaltyBPS` to arbitrary value.
- The attacker sets themselves as an `artist`, and gets the possibility to call the [`PhiFactory::updateArtSettings()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L215-L227) function, thus setting the parameters to arbitrary values, e.g. `maxSupply`, `endTime`, or `mintFee`.

### Proof of Concept

Drop this test to [PhiFactory.t.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/test/PhiFactory.t.sol#L246) and execute via `forge test --match-test Kuprum`:

```solidity
function testKuprum_ImpersonateArtist() public {
    // The owner prepares the signature, the config,
    //  and submits the `createArt` transaction
    string memory artIdURL = "sample-art-id";
    bytes memory credData = abi.encode(1, owner, "SIGNATURE", 31_337, bytes32(0));
    bytes memory signCreateData = abi.encode(expiresIn, artIdURL, credData);
    bytes32 createMsgHash = keccak256(signCreateData);
    bytes32 createDigest = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(createMsgHash);
    (uint8 cv, bytes32 cr, bytes32 cs) = vm.sign(claimSignerPrivateKey, createDigest);
    if (cv != 27) cs = cs | bytes32(uint256(1) << 255);
    IPhiFactory.CreateConfig memory config =
        IPhiFactory.CreateConfig(artCreator, receiver, END_TIME, START_TIME, MAX_SUPPLY, MINT_FEE, false);
    
    // user1 observes `createArt` transaction in the mempool, and frontruns it,
    // reusing the signature, but with their own config where user1 is the receiver
    vm.deal(user1, 1 ether);
    vm.startPrank(user1);
    IPhiFactory.CreateConfig memory user1Config =
        IPhiFactory.CreateConfig(artCreator, user1, END_TIME, START_TIME, MAX_SUPPLY, MINT_FEE, false);
    phiFactory.createArt{ value: NFT_ART_CREATE_FEE }(signCreateData, abi.encodePacked(cr, cs), user1Config);

    // Owner's `createArt` succeeds; there is also no difference in the `ArtContractCreated` event
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    phiFactory.createArt{ value: NFT_ART_CREATE_FEE }(signCreateData, abi.encodePacked(cr, cs), config);

    // Verify that user1 is now the royalties recipient
    uint256 artIdNum = 1;
    IPhiFactory.ArtData memory updatedArt = phiFactory.artData(artIdNum);
    assertEq(updatedArt.receiver, user1, "user1 should be the royalties recipient");
}
```

### Tools Used

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

We recommend the following steps:

- In [`PhiFactory::createArt()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L196-L213):
    - Include into the signed data the `CreateConfig` parameters.
    - Limit transaction execution to a specific submitter.
- In [`PhiFactory::createERC1155Internal()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L551-L568) fail the transaction if the contract already exists.

 > We will disregard the proposed mitigation, because it's incorrect. Instead, we will extend the signature by introducing nonce, creator, and executor. However, I believe this issue should be classified as Medium rather than High.

## [[H-03] `shareBalance` bloating eventually blocks curator rewards distribution](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/65)

Cred curator share balances are tracked by the following data structure in the `Cred`:

```solidity
    mapping(uint256 credId => EnumerableMap.AddressToUintMap balance) private shareBalance;
```

There may be `MAX_SUPPLY = 999` maximum curators of a cred. However, when a curator sells all their shares, the curator entry still remains in the data structure with a zero shares number. Because of that the mapping grows unlimited. As soon as about 4000 different addresses owned (for any time period) a cred's share, the current shareholders, regardless of their current number, will be no longer enumerable by `CuratorRewardsDistributor`. Rewards
distribution for this cred will be blocked because gas usage hits the block gas limit.

Have a look at the curator share balance update code:

```solidity
    function _updateCuratorShareBalance(uint256 credId_, address sender_, uint256 amount_, bool isBuy) internal {
        (, uint256 currentNum) = shareBalance[credId_].tryGet(sender_);

        if (isBuy) {
            if (currentNum == 0 && !_credIdExistsPerAddress[sender_][credId_]) {
                _addCredIdPerAddress(credId_, sender_);
                _credIdExistsPerAddress[sender_][credId_] = true;
            }
            shareBalance[credId_].set(sender_, currentNum + amount_);
        } else {
            if ((currentNum - amount_) == 0) {
                _removeCredIdPerAddress(credId_, sender_);
                _credIdExistsPerAddress[sender_][credId_] = false;
            }
            shareBalance[credId_].set(sender_, currentNum - amount_);
        }
    }
```

When all shares are sold by the curator, its balance is set to `0` rather than deleted from the `EnumerableMap`.

During rewards distribution, a call to `getCuratorAddresses` is made. The control goes to `_getCuratorData` function which enumerates all entries of `shareBalance[credId]`:

```solidity
        uint256 stopIndex;
        if (stop_ == 0 || stop_ > shareBalance[credId_].length()) {
            stopIndex = shareBalance[credId_].length();
        } else {
            stopIndex = stop_;
        }

        // ...
        for (uint256 i = start_; i < stopIndex; ++i) {
            (address key, uint256 shareAmount) = shareBalance[credId_].at(i);
```

Reading storage slots is quite an expensive operation nowadays. The execution will eventually hit the block gas limit and the transaction will be reverted. Details of `sload` costs and block gas limit may vary from chain to chain, but the DoS possibility never goes away.

Besides, take into account that storage access costs may increase significantly, rendering the discussed code unexecutable. Such a change may be introduced in a hardfork, e.g., the cost of the `sload` opcode was increased 10 times recently.

### Impact

If a cred is used and traded long enough (which is the intended state of the matter, presumably), the rewards of such a cred will be undistributable. Besides that, a griefing may be executed to block existing rewards (please see discussion in the PoC). Assets (rewards) of curators can be lost in that case until a code upgrade is made. If the contract was not upgradeable, that would be a high-risk situation in my opinion.

### Proof of Concept

Please insert this test into `test/CuratorRewardsDistributor.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test testBloatingBalances -vv --gas-limit 2000000000 --block-gas-limit 2000000000 --isolate`.

Please note:

- The PoC illustrates gas usage over 30Mgas (the current Ethereum block gas limit). Details of `sload` costs and block gas limit may vary from chain to chain.
- Higher gas limit options are needed for the initial setup of the test.
- `--isolate` option is needed to "disable" slot re-read discounts which manifest themselves since `shareBalance` slots are actively read during the setup phase.

```solidity
    function testBloatingBalances() public {
        uint256 credId = 1;
        uint256 depositAmount = 1 ether;

        // Deposit some ETH to the curatorRewardsDistributor
        curatorRewardsDistributor.deposit{ value: depositAmount }(credId, depositAmount);

        // A similar piece of code may be executed by a griefer to block rewards distribution.
        // However, instead of `vm.startPrank` he'll have to resort to lightweight proxy contracts or EIP-7702.
        // `SHARE_LOCK_PERIOD` won't be a problem since several accounts can trade shares in parallel.
        // If the cred is not far into the bonding curve, the griefing can be done cheaply.
        for (uint i = 0; i < 4000; i++) {
            address trader = address(uint160(i + 1000));
            vm.deal(trader, 0.1 ether);
            vm.startPrank(trader);
            cred.buyShareCred{value: 0.1 ether}(credId, 1, 0);
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 minutes + 1 seconds);
            cred.sellShareCred(credId, 1, 0);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        uint gas = gasleft();
        vm.prank(user2);
        curatorRewardsDistributor.distribute(credId);
        uint gasSpend = gas - gasleft();

        console2.log("`distribute()` gas: ", gasSpend);
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove zero entries from the map:

```solidity
    function _updateCuratorShareBalance(uint256 credId_, address sender_, uint256 amount_, bool isBuy) internal {
        (, uint256 currentNum) = shareBalance[credId_].tryGet(sender_);

        if (isBuy) {
            if (currentNum == 0 && !_credIdExistsPerAddress[sender_][credId_]) {
                _addCredIdPerAddress(credId_, sender_);
                _credIdExistsPerAddress[sender_][credId_] = true;
            }
            shareBalance[credId_].set(sender_, currentNum + amount_);
        } else {
            if ((currentNum - amount_) == 0) {
                _removeCredIdPerAddress(credId_, sender_);
                _credIdExistsPerAddress[sender_][credId_] = false;
+               shareBalance[credId_].remove(sender_);
            }
+           else
                shareBalance[credId_].set(sender_, currentNum - amount_);
        }
    }

## [[H-04] Forced `endTime` extension in `updateArtSettings()` allows attacker to mint more tokens](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/54)
*Submitted by [MrPotatoMagic](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/54)*

The function `updateArtSettings()` allows an artist to update the art settings for their artwork at any time. Specifically, it allows updating the `receiver`, `maxSupply`, `mintFee`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `soulBounded` and `uri` of the PhiArt struct as well as the royalty configuration.

### Issue

The issue is that if the artist wants to update the art settings after the claiming/minting event from `startTime` to `endTime` is over, the artist is forced to extend the `endTime` to atleast the current `block.timestamp`. The artist would be wanting to update the `uri` or the `soulBounded` value (in case it might be the artist's idea to keep or not keep soulbounded initially and then later on change the value to make it not soulbounded or soulbounded) or even updating the configuration for royalties for secondary sales post the event.

### Impact

Since the artist is forced to extend the `endTime` to `block.timestamp`, a malicious user keeping track of such calls to `updateArtSettings()` can backrun the artist's transaction with a `merkleClaim()` call to mint any amount of tokens for that `artId`. Since the validation [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L711) would not cause a revert, the call goes through successfully.

### Proof of Concept

Let's say the event occurred from `t = 0` to `t = 100`. A total of 500 tokens were minted out of 1000; i.e., the `maxSupply`.

1. Artist calls `updateArtSettings()` to update the `uri`, `soulBounded` value or royalty configuration.
    - Due to the check on Line 242, `endTime` parameter needs to be at least `block.timestamp` to update the settings the artist wants to.
    - The artist's call goes through and sets the `endTime` to `block.timestamp` and makes the respective changes to the settings the artist wanted to change; i.e., `uri`, `soulBounded` value or royalty configuration.

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
220:     function updateArtSettings(
221:         uint256 artId_,
222:         string memory url_,
223:         address receiver_,
224:         uint256 maxSupply_,
225:         uint256 mintFee_,
226:         uint256 startTime_,
227:         uint256 endTime_,
228:         bool soulBounded_,
229:         IPhiNFT1155Ownable.RoyaltyConfiguration memory configuration
230:     )
231:         external
232:         onlyArtCreator(artId_)
233:     {
234:         if (receiver_ == address(0)) {
235:             revert InvalidAddressZero();
236:         }
237: 
238:         if (endTime_ < startTime_) {
239:             revert InvalidTimeRange();
240:         }
241:         
242:         if (endTime_ < block.timestamp) {
243:             revert EndTimeInPast();
244:         }
245: 
246:         PhiArt storage art = arts[artId_];
247: 
248:         if (art.numberMinted > maxSupply_) {
249:             revert ExceedMaxSupply();
250:         }
251: 
252:         art.receiver = receiver_;
253:         art.maxSupply = maxSupply_;
254:         art.mintFee = mintFee_;
255:         art.startTime = startTime_;
256:         art.endTime = endTime_;
257:         art.soulBounded = soulBounded_;
258:         art.uri = url_;
259: 
260:         uint256 tokenId = IPhiNFT1155Ownable(art.artAddress).getTokenIdFromFactoryArtId(artId_);
261:         IPhiNFT1155Ownable(art.artAddress).updateRoyalties(tokenId, configuration);
262:        ...
263:     }
```

2. A malicious user who was part of the merkle root in the past backruns the artist's transaction with a `merkleClaim()` function call.
    - The malicious user supplies the proof and leafPart from a past transaction done during the event.
    - The `encodeData_` parameter supplied would contain the minter address the malicious user was eligible with and the artId for which the settings were updated for.
    - The merkle claiming does not verify any other info such as quantity, which allows the user to input any amount of tokens to mint in the `MintArgs mintArgs` parameter.
    - The call moves to the `_validateAndUpdateClaimState()` internal function.

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
361:     function merkleClaim(
362:         bytes32[] calldata proof_,
363:         bytes calldata encodeData_,
364:         MintArgs calldata mintArgs_,
365:         bytes32 leafPart_
366:     )
367:         external
368:         payable
369:         whenNotPaused
370:     {
371:         (address minter_, address ref_, uint256 artId_) = abi.decode(encodeData_, (address, address, uint256));
372:         PhiArt storage art = arts[artId_];
373: 
374:         bytes32 credMerkleRootHash = credMerkleRoot[art.credChainId][art.credId];
375:         if (minter_ == address(0) || !art.verificationType.eq("MERKLE") || credMerkleRootHash == bytes32(0)) {
376:             revert InvalidMerkleProof();
377:         }
378:         
380:         if (
381:             !MerkleProofLib.verifyCalldata(
382:                 proof_, credMerkleRootHash, keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(minter_, leafPart_))))
383:             )
384:         ) {
385:             revert InvalidMerkleProof();
386:         }
387: 
388:         _validateAndUpdateClaimState(artId_, minter_, mintArgs_.quantity);
389:         _processClaim(
390:             artId_, minter_, ref_, art.credCreator, mintArgs_.quantity, leafPart_, mintArgs_.imageURI, msg.value
391:         );
392: 
393:         ...
394:     }
```

3. In the function `_validateAndUpdateClaimState()`, the following occurs:
    - Line 727 evaluates to false since `block.timestamp > endTime` is not true since `endTime = block.timestamp`.
    - Line 729, since only 500 tokens were minted out of 1000 `maxSupply`, the malicious user can mint as many tokens up to the max supply.

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
718:     function _validateAndUpdateClaimState(uint256 artId_, address minter_, uint256 quantity_) private {
719:         PhiArt storage art = arts[artId_];
720: 
721:         // Common validations
722:         if (tx.origin != _msgSender() && msg.sender != art.artAddress && msg.sender != address(this)) {
723:             revert TxOriginMismatch();
724:         }
725:         if (msg.value < getArtMintFee(artId_, quantity_)) revert InvalidMintFee();
726:         if (block.timestamp < art.startTime) revert ArtNotStarted();
727:         if (block.timestamp > art.endTime) revert ArtEnded(); 
728:         if (quantity_ == 0) revert InvalidQuantity();
729:         if (art.numberMinted + quantity_ > art.maxSupply) revert OverMaxAllowedToMint();
730: 
731:         // Common state updates
732:         if (!credMinted[art.credChainId][art.credId][minter_]) {
733:             credMinted[art.credChainId][art.credId][minter_] = true;
734:         }
735:         artMinted[artId_][minter_] = true;
736:         art.numberMinted += quantity_;
737:     }
```

4. The call returns back to the `merkleClaim()` function where the `_processClaim()` function proceeds to mint the `minter` address the tokens.

Through this, we can see how post-event, a artist was forced to extend the `endTime` to `block.timestamp` at least, which opened up a window of opportunity for a malicious user to mint tokens.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider providing a separate function to update the `uri`, `soulBounded` and royalty config settings since these values are most likely to be updated post an event. Additionally, as a safety measure use `>=` instead of `>` in the check [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L711).

> The reason why I think excessive minting is an issue is since once NFTs are being traded on external marketplaces, there are only limited amount of tokens in circulation (that have monetary value attached to them). If an artist updates the art settings and is forced to extend the `endTime` to `block.timestamp`, an attacker could use this opportunity to mint more tokens into circulation (indirectly receiving more monetary value as well as diluting the value of NFTs in the external market over time). Since there wasn't an ongoing event during which the minting occurs, this would fall under unauthorized minting that an artist wouldn't have expected after the original event ended.

> Lastly, I also disagree with the comment that it does not affect the artist. It does affect the artist, since if this unauthorized minting occurs, it dilutes the value of the NFT in the external marketplace. This means the price per NFT drops and thus the royalties the artist receives are lesser since royalties are based on sale price as per EIP-2981, which is utilized by the protocol currently in CreatorRoyaltiesControl.sol.

The `_addCredIdPerAddress` and `_removeCredIdPerAddress` allows anyone to interrupt users who are attempting to hold cred shares & sell already held cred shares.

### Proof of Concept

Anyone can force several scenarios some of such as making the following:

- `_credIdsPerAddress` huge with non-existent `credIds` that then lead to issues.
- Forcing a block gas limit for chains whose gas fees are cheap such as Base, Avax C-Chain, etc.
- Repeatedly forcing new cred share holders' transactions to fail with a combination of removing the `credIds` then adding them right after.
- They can re-order the `credId` indexes forcing the function to revert when trying to remove cred ID's per addresses:

```solidity
// Get the index of the credId to remove
        uint256 indexToRemove = _credIdsPerAddressCredIdIndex[sender_][credId_];
        // Check if the index is valid
        if (indexToRemove >= _credIdsPerAddress[sender_].length) revert IndexOutofBounds();

        // Verify that the credId at the index matches the one we want to remove
        uint256 credIdToRemove = _credIdsPerAddress[sender_][indexToRemove];
        if (credId_ != credIdToRemove) revert WrongCredId();
```

```solidity
function _addCredIdPerAddress(uint256 credId_, address sender_) public {
        // Add the new credId to the array
        _credIdsPerAddress[sender_].push(credId_);
        // Store the index of the new credId
        _credIdsPerAddressCredIdIndex[sender_][credId_] = _credIdsPerAddressArrLength[sender_];
        // Increment the array length counter
        _credIdsPerAddressArrLength[sender_]++;
    }

    // Function to remove a credId from the address's list
    function _removeCredIdPerAddress(uint256 credId_, address sender_) public {
        // Check if the array is empty
        if (_credIdsPerAddress[sender_].length == 0) revert EmptyArray();

        // Get the index of the credId to remove
        uint256 indexToRemove = _credIdsPerAddressCredIdIndex[sender_][credId_];
        // Check if the index is valid
        if (indexToRemove >= _credIdsPerAddress[sender_].length) revert IndexOutofBounds();

        // Verify that the credId at the index matches the one we want to remove
        uint256 credIdToRemove = _credIdsPerAddress[sender_][indexToRemove];
        if (credId_ != credIdToRemove) revert WrongCredId();

        // Get the last element in the array
        uint256 lastIndex = _credIdsPerAddress[sender_].length - 1;
        uint256 lastCredId = _credIdsPerAddress[sender_][lastIndex];
        // Move the last element to the position of the element we're removing
        _credIdsPerAddress[sender_][indexToRemove] = lastCredId;

        // Update the index of the moved element, if it's not the one we're removing
        if (indexToRemove < lastIndex) {
            _credIdsPerAddressCredIdIndex[sender_][lastCredId] = indexToRemove;
        }

        // Remove the last element (which is now a duplicate)
        _credIdsPerAddress[sender_].pop();

        // Remove the index mapping for the removed credId
        delete _credIdsPerAddressCredIdIndex[sender_][credIdToRemove];

        // Decrement the array length counter, if it's greater than 0
        if (_credIdsPerAddressArrLength[sender_] > 0) {
            _credIdsPerAddressArrLength[sender_]--;
        }
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Make both functions internal rather than public.

### Vulnerability Details

During cred creation, the sender automatically buys 1 share of the cred. During share purchases, a refund is issued if Ether provided by the sender exceeds the value needed. It allows an attacker to reenter both cred creation and share trading functions. Which, in turn, allows the attacker to overwrite cred data before the `credIdCounter` is incremented. This fact introduces a critical vulnerability in the case when there is more than one whitelisted bonding curve. The attacker can purchase shares cheaply, overwrite the cred, and sell the shares expensively, almost depleting the entire contract balance.

Let's discuss a possible attack vector in detail.

Preparations. The attacker prepares two sets of cred creation data which may be quite legit. The most important aspect is that the first set uses a "cheaper" bonding curve and the other uses a more expensive one (see the Impact section for more details). The sender's address would be a helper contract address. However, the attacker doesn't need to deploy the contract beforehand to know its address, since there are several ways to know a to-be-deployed contract address without exposing its bytecode (e.g. by deployer address and nonce or with the help of the `CREATE2` opcode). To sum up, at the moment of checking cred creation data and signing there are no signs of malignancy.

Then, the attacker deploys the helper contract and invokes an attack. Further actions are executed by the contract in a single transaction as follows.

1. The attacker creates the first cred, with the cheap `IBondingCurve` used. The cred creation code invokes `buyShareCred(credIdCounter, 1, 0);` as part of its job. The attacker provides excess Ether, so a refund is triggered and the control goes back to the attacker. Note that [the counter increment](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L574) is not reached yet.

    ```solidity
        function _createCredInternal(
            address creator_,
            string memory credURL_,
            string memory credType_,
            string memory verificationType_,
            address bondingCurve_,
            uint16 buyShareRoyalty_,
            uint16 sellShareRoyalty_
        )
            internal
            whenNotPaused
            returns (uint256)
        {
            if (creator_ == address(0)) {
                revert InvalidAddressZero();
            }
    
            creds[credIdCounter].creator = creator_;
            creds[credIdCounter].credURL = credURL_;
            creds[credIdCounter].credType = credType_;
            creds[credIdCounter].verificationType = verificationType_;
            creds[credIdCounter].bondingCurve = bondingCurve_;
            creds[credIdCounter].createdAt = uint40(block.timestamp);
            creds[credIdCounter].buyShareRoyalty = buyShareRoyalty_;
            creds[credIdCounter].sellShareRoyalty = sellShareRoyalty_;
    
            buyShareCred(credIdCounter, 1, 0);
    
            emit CredCreated(creator_, credIdCounter, credURL_, credType_, verificationType_);
    
            credIdCounter += 1;
    
            return credIdCounter - 1;
        }
    ```

2. The attacker buys some amount of shares of the almost created cred by invoking [buyShareCred](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L178). Note that there are no significant obstacles to doing that as the attacker can employ a flash loan. Again, the attacker provides excess Ether, so a refund is triggered and the control goes back to the attacker.
 
3. Remember that the control is still nested in `buyShareCred` nested in the first `createCred`. This time the attacker invokes the [createCred](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L232-L241) again, with the second cred creation data, with a more expensive bonding curve used. Note that there are no reentrancy guards in `createCred`, `buyShareCred`, or `sellShareCred`. The data is passed to [_createCredInternal](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L557-L570) where it overwrites the first cred contents in the `creds[credIdCounter]` (remember, the counter is not incremented yet by the first `createCred`). [Here is](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L565) the most important part of the overwriting for the attacker: they just changed the bonding curve.

    ```solidity
        creds[credIdCounter].bondingCurve = bondingCurve_;
    ```

A couple of lines below `buyShareCred` will be hit again and the attacker grabs back the control in the usual manner.

4. Now the attacker calls `sellShareCred` and dumps as many purchased shares as possible until depleting the Cred balance or his own share balance. The "more expensive" bonding curve gives the attacker more Ether than they spend while buying on step 2. Note that the share lock time also won't help as the timestamp [is not yet set](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L644), which is the subject of another finding.

    ```solidity
        if (isBuy) {
            cred.currentSupply += amount_;
            uint256 excessPayment = msg.value - price - protocolFee - creatorFee;
            if (excessPayment > 0) {
                _msgSender().safeTransferETH(excessPayment);
            }
            lastTradeTimestamp[credId_][curator_] = block.timestamp;
        } else {
            cred.currentSupply -= amount_;
            curator_.safeTransferETH(price - protocolFee - creatorFee);
        }
    ```
   
Even if the `SHARE_LOCK_PERIOD` was honored, that would mean that the attacker has to wait 10 minutes before pocketing the profit. That would make the situation a bit more difficult for the attacker, but still highly dangerous for the protocol.

5. At this moment almost all Ether from the Cred contract is transferred to the attacker's contract. The attacker has to keep some of the Ether intact since now the unwinding of the nested calls is happening (and some fees are paid): the second `createCred`, `buyShareCred`, and the first `createCred`.

### Impact

As soon as there is more than one bonding curve whitelisted in the protocol, the vulnerability allows to drain almost entire protocol funds. Whitelisting more than one curve [seems to be an expected behavior](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L159-L166).

Fine-tuning the numbers to exploit the bonding curve price differences is a mere technicality, e.g. if there was just a 10% price difference that would be more than enough to perform an attack. Also note that on the current codebase, the attack may be repeated numerously and instantly.

### Proof of Concept

Please apply the patch to the `test/Cred.t.sol` and run with `forge test --match-test testCredDraining -vv`.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To mitigate this attack vector it would be enough to add a reentrancy guard [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L241):

```solidity
    function createCred(
        address creator_,
        bytes calldata signedData_,
        bytes calldata signature_,
        uint16 buyShareRoyalty_,
        uint16 sellShareRoyalty_
    )
        public
        payable
        whenNotPaused
+       nonReentrant
    {
```

* However, I recommend protecting with reentrancy guards all protocol functions directly or indirectly dealing with assets or important state.
* Another important measure to consider is adhering to the [Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern).

The [`updateArtSettings`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L215) function in the PhiFactory contract allows artists to modify several key settings of their art at any time. These settings include the `URI` link, royalty fee and `soulBounded` (non-transferable) feature.

```solidity
    function updateArtSettings(
        uint256 artId_,
        string memory url_,
        address receiver_,
        uint256 maxSupply_,
        uint256 mintFee_,
        uint256 startTime_,
        uint256 endTime_,
        bool soulBounded_,
        IPhiNFT1155Ownable.RoyaltyConfiguration memory configuration
    )
        external
        onlyArtCreator(artId_)
    {
        ...
        art.receiver = receiver_;
        art.maxSupply = maxSupply_;
        art.mintFee = mintFee_;
        art.startTime = startTime_;
        art.endTime = endTime_;
        art.soulBounded = soulBounded_;
        art.uri = url_;

        uint256 tokenId = IPhiNFT1155Ownable(art.artAddress).getTokenIdFromFactoryArtId(artId_);
        IPhiNFT1155Ownable(art.artAddress).updateRoyalties(tokenId, configuration);
        emit ArtUpdated(artId_, url_, receiver_, maxSupply_, mintFee_, startTime_, endTime_, soulBounded_);
    }
```

The problem is that there are no restrictions or limitations on how these settings can be changed after the art has been created and minted. This flexibility allows artists to alter critical functionalities in ways that could negatively impact existing holders:

1. **Changing `Soulbound` Status**: Artists can toggle the `soulBounded` status to lock transfers, effectively trapping users who purchased NFTs under the assumption they were transferable.
2. **Modifying Royalties**: Artists can set royalty fees to extremely high values after initial sales, forcing holders to pay unexpected fees upon resale.
3. **Updating URLs**: Artists can change the `linkURI`, potentially misleading users or affecting the NFTâ€™s perceived value by altering the associated content. In the worst case, the URL could be changed to a malicious link, posing security risks to users who interact with it.

These changes can be made at any time, without prior notice to holders, leaving users vulnerable to unfavourable adjustments.

### Impact

Allowing unrestricted changes to critical token settings poses a significant risk to the stability and trustworthiness of the NFTs. Users who have already minted or purchased NFTs could be adversely affected by changes they did not agree to, such as increased fees or transfer restrictions.

### Recommendation

Implement limits on how and when critical settings can be changed, such as capping royalty rates. This would help protect users while maintaining some flexibility for artists.

# Medium Risk Findings (8)
## [[M-01] Contract `PhiNFT1155` can't be paused](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/268)
*Submitted by [kuprum](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/268), also found by [MrPotatoMagic](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/380), [Rhaydden](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/375), [hail\_the\_lord](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/374), [Gosho](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/325), [inh3l](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/81), and [DigiSafe](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/61)*

The pausing mechanism of `PhiNFT1155` contract is implemented incorrectly and doesn't work. Users are still able to transfer NFTs in paused state.

### Summary

Contract `PhiNFT1155` inherits from the [following parent contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol#L21-L31):

```solidity
contract PhiNFT1155 is
    Initializable,
    UUPSUpgradeable,
    ERC1155SupplyUpgradeable,
    ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    IPhiNFT1155,
    Claimable,
    CreatorRoyaltiesControl
{
```

The problem with the above is that inheriting from `PausableUpgradeable` is not effective in the scope of OZ `ERC1155` contracts. As a result, users are able to transfer NFT tokens even when the contract is paused, as the below PoC demonstrates.

### Proof of Concept

Drop this test to [PhiFactory.t.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/test/PhiFactory.t.sol#L163) and execute via `forge test --match-test Kuprum`:

```solidity
function testKuprum_PhiNFT1155PauseNotWorking() public {
    _createArt(ART_ID_URL_STRING);
    uint256 artId = 1;
    bytes32 advanced_data = bytes32("1");
    bytes memory signData =
        abi.encode(expiresIn, participant, referrer, verifier, artId, block.chainid, advanced_data);
    bytes32 msgHash = keccak256(signData);
    bytes32 digest = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(msgHash);
    (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(claimSignerPrivateKey, digest);
    if (v != 27) s = s | bytes32(uint256(1) << 255);
    bytes memory signature = abi.encodePacked(r, s);
    bytes memory data =
        abi.encode(1, participant, referrer, verifier, expiresIn, uint256(1), advanced_data, IMAGE_URL, signature);
    bytes memory dataCompressed = LibZip.cdCompress(data);
    uint256 totalMintFee = phiFactory.getArtMintFee(1, 1);

    vm.startPrank(participant, participant);
    phiFactory.claim{ value: totalMintFee }(dataCompressed);

    // referrer payout
    address artAddress = phiFactory.getArtAddress(1);
    assertEq(IERC1155(artAddress).balanceOf(participant, 1), 1, "participant erc1155 balance");
    
    // Everything up to here is from `test_claim_1155_with_ref`
    
    // Owner pauses the art contract
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    phiFactory.pauseArtContract(artAddress);

    // Users are still able to transfer NFTs despite the contract being paused
    assertEq(IERC1155(artAddress).balanceOf(user1, 1), 0, "user1 doesn't have any tokens");
    vm.startPrank(participant);
    IERC1155(artAddress).safeTransferFrom(participant, user1, 1, 1, hex"00");
    assertEq(IERC1155(artAddress).balanceOf(participant, 1), 0, "participant now has 0 tokens");
    assertEq(IERC1155(artAddress).balanceOf(user1, 1), 1, "user1 now has 1 token");
}

The protocol is unable to set the correct mint fee of 0.00005 ETH per NFT minted, as [documented in the specifications](https://docs.philand.xyz/explore-phi/phi-protocol):

       Mint Fee
       This fee is applied when a Minter wants to mint a Cred NFT.
       Protocol will have a mint price/fee of 0.00005 ETH.

```js
    function setProtocolFee(uint256 protocolFee_) external onlyOwner {
        if (protocolFee_ > 10_000) revert ProtocolFeeTooHigh(); // @audit <== This check is incorrect
        mintProtocolFee = protocolFee_;
        emit ProtocolFeeSet(protocolFee_);
    }

    function setArtCreatFee(uint256 artCreateFee_) external onlyOwner {
        if (artCreateFee_ > 10_000) revert ArtCreatFeeTooHigh(); // @audit <== This check is incorrect
        artCreateFee = artCreateFee_;
        emit ArtCreatFeeSet(artCreateFee_);
    }
```

This discrepancy between the intended fee (0.00005 ETH) and the maximum settable fee (10,000 wei) renders the fee adjustment mechanism ineffective.

The protocol loses the ability to adjust its revenue model in response to market conditions or strategic decisions, as both the mint fee and art creation fee are effectively locked at their initial values.

Below lines demonstrate that the fees are being applied as direct values rather than percentages, contrary to the setter functions' assumptions.

From `src/PhiFactory.sol`:

```solidity
   function _processClaim(
        uint256 artId_,
        address minter_,
        address ref_,
        address verifier_,
        uint256 quantity_,
        bytes32 data_,
        string memory imageURI_,
        uint256 etherValue_
    )
        private
    {
        PhiArt storage art = arts[artId_];

        // Handle refund
        uint256 mintFee = getArtMintFee(artId_, quantity_);
        if ((etherValue_ - mintFee) > 0) {
            _msgSender().safeTransferETH(etherValue_ - mintFee);
        }
        protocolFeeDestination.safeTransferETH(mintProtocolFee * quantity_); // @audit
```

From `src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol`:

```js
   function createArtFromFactory(uint256 artId_) external payable onlyPhiFactory whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
        _artIdToTokenId[artId_] = tokenIdCounter;
        _tokenIdToArtId[tokenIdCounter] = artId_;

        uint256 artFee = phiFactoryContract.artCreateFee();

        protocolFeeDestination.safeTransferETH(artFee); // @audit
```

It's important to note that while the immediate financial impact may be limited if the initial fees were set correctly, the long-term implications of this inflexibility could be significant for the protocol's adaptability and financial management.

### Proof of Concept

This POC demonstrates the inability to set the correct protocol and art creation fees as intended by the protocol.

1. Add the test to the `TestPhiFactory` contract in `test/PhiFactory.t.sol`.
2. Run `forge test --mt test_ChangeProtocolFees`.

```js
function test_ChangeProtocolFees() public {
    assertEq(phiFactory.owner(), owner, "owner is correct");
    assertEq(phiFactory.mintProtocolFee(), PROTOCOL_FEE, "protocolFee is correct");

    vm.startPrank(owner);
    // maximum 10000 wei is allowed, but according to protocol documentations and deploy script it should be 0.00005 ether
    vm.expectRevert(IPhiFactory.ProtocolFeeTooHigh.selector);
    phiFactory.setProtocolFee(10001);

    vm.expectRevert(IPhiFactory.ProtocolFeeTooHigh.selector);
    phiFactory.setProtocolFee(0.00005 ether);

    vm.expectRevert(IPhiFactory.ArtCreatFeeTooHigh.selector);
    phiFactory.setArtCreatFee(10001);

    vm.expectRevert(IPhiFactory.ArtCreatFeeTooHigh.selector);
    phiFactory.setArtCreatFee(0.00005 ether);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

```diff
+   uint constant MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE = 0.00005 ether;
+   uint constant MAX_ART_CREATE_FEE = 0.00005 ether;

    function setProtocolFee(uint256 protocolFee_) external onlyOwner {
-       if (protocolFee_ > 10_000) revert ProtocolFeeTooHigh();
+       if (protocolFee_ > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE) revert ProtocolFeeTooHigh();
        mintProtocolFee = protocolFee_;
        emit ProtocolFeeSet(protocolFee_);
    }

    function setArtCreatFee(uint256 artCreateFee_) external onlyOwner {
-       if (artCreateFee_ > 10_000) revert ArtCreatFeeTooHigh();
+       if (artCreateFee_ > MAX_ART_CREATE_FEE) revert ArtCreatFeeTooHigh();
        artCreateFee = artCreateFee_;
        emit ArtCreatFeeSet(artCreateFee_);
    }
```

If the `mintFee` was lowered by the Art creator via `updateArtSettings` before the `claim` was executed, the `msg.value` from user would become larger than the updated value of `mintFee`. As the function does not validate `msg.value` and consumes the `mintFee` directly, the excess ETH sent by the user will not be refunded, causing a loss of funds for user.

If `PhiFactory` still holds positive ETH balance, a malicious user can exploit this by sending less `msg.value` than expected (or no ETH at all). This results in `PhiFactory`'s ETH being used for the `mintFee` payment instead, causing a loss for the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

This external call to `this.merkleClaim` forwards the `mintFee` value of ETH without validating it against `msg.value`.

- Found in [src/PhiFactory.sol at Line 283](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/main/src/PhiFactory.sol#L283)

    ```solidity
    264:    function claim(bytes calldata encodeData_) external payable {
        ...
    282:            uint256 mintFee = getArtMintFee(artId, quantity_);
    283: =>             this.merkleClaim{ value: mintFee }(proof, claimData, mintArgs, leafPart_); 
    284:        } else if (art.verificationType.eq("SIGNATURE")) {
        ...
    304:    }
    ```

Similarly, this external call to `this.signatureClaim` forwards the `mintFee` value of ETH without validating it against `msg.value`.

- Found in [src/PhiFactory.sol at Line 300](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/main/src/PhiFactory.sol#L300)

    ```solidity
    264:    function claim(bytes calldata encodeData_) external payable {
        ...
    299:            uint256 mintFee = getArtMintFee(artId, quantity_);
    300: =>             this.signatureClaim{ value: mintFee }(signature_, claimData, mintArgs);
    301:        } else {
        ...
    304:    }
    ```

Although the `merkleClaim` and `signatureClaim` functions can process refunds, the `claim` function calls of these two functions `externally` (defined as `external` instead of `public`), results in the `msg.value` being overridden by the `mintFee`. As a result, the original `msg.value` sent to `claim()` remains unvalidated and become vulnerable to exploits.

This confirms both cases where `msg.value > mintFee` and `msg.value = 0` could be exploited, causing loss of funds for both users and the protocol.

### Tools Used

Foundry test

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Validate `msg.value` against `mintFee` to ensure the caller sent in the correct amount of ETH. Or, forward `msg.value` directly to subsequent claim process since the `_processClaim` will eventually handle the refund.

## [[M-04] Cred creator could cause stuck funds](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/74)
*Submitted by [petarP1998](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/74)*

Update of cred can be triggered by the cred creator. If there are already issued shares for users, and the cred creator decides to update the `sellShareRoyalty_` this will lead users to pay up to 50% fee depending on the value. And users will be in situation that to withdraw their funds, they need to pay 50% to the cred creator and additionally some fee to the protocol.

### Proof of Concept

We have the following situation:

1. 500 issued shares and the current sell fee is 0.05%.
2. And the cred creator decides to increase the fee to 50%.
3. If any of the users wants to withdraw funds, they need to pay 50% to the creator and also protocol fee.

For example, let's imagine that the current number of shares issued is 500 of max 999 and one of the users is owner of 5 shares. If we add this test to `Cred.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_value() public {
        uint256 x = bondingCurve.getSellPrice(500, 5);
        assertEq(153_019_801_980_198_020, x);
    }
```

We will see that the sell price is around `1.53e17` which in the current price is equal to `$420`, this means that the 50% or `$210` will be paid to the cred creator as fee, which will lead to significant lose of funds for share holders. If the number of shares that are issued the lose is growing.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

The protocol should implement a mechanism where this type of updates, will be applied after some period. I will explain my idea in the below lines:

1. If cred creator wants to increase the `sellShareRoyalty_`, it should first create a request for updating which can be applied after 2 days, for example.
2. In these two days users who are not okay with the new value of `sellShareRoyalty_` can withdraw their funds from the protocol.

My proposal is to have two functions:

1. `updateSellShareRoyaltyRequest` which will create this request and this request can be approved after some period.
2. `approveUpdateSellShareRoyaltyRequest` if the period already passed the cred creator can apply the change.

 > The observation is valid. However, I believe the main issue is the ability to update the royalty percentage. The high percentage is deliberately set to allow creators to set up creds where they prefer to minimize sharing with others. Therefore, my plan is to keep the current high percentage limit, but remove the update functionality altogether. This vulnerability should be rated medium severity in my opinion.

> The main intention behind creds is for users to form, visualize, showcase their onchain identity. When a cred is created, the creator (i.e., the onchain identity) is the source of trust when users buy up their shares. This means, the more social, reputed and trusted an identity is, the lower are the chances of a creator wanting to perform such an attack. 
> 
> It is highly unlikely a high reputed creator would want to perform such an attack. When it comes to low reputed creators, who are more likely to perform this attack, the impact would be low because the shares being bought for such untrusted entities would not be high (Note: This claim is based on onchain data I've observed from a similar protocol). If we look at the [price curve](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wHi9Mqo9YU8EUMQuUvuC75Dav6NSY5LOw-iDlkrZEA/edit?pli=1&gid=859106557#gid=859106557), even if 5-10 shares were bought by users, the overall loss would be minimum and bearable, considering that users know the risk when buying shares of untrusted onchain identities.
> 
> I think the above points along with the fact that 0-50% is an acceptable range defined by the protocol as per sponsor's comments above, it seems that this issue is rather suited for QA-severity.

## [[M-05] Lack of data validation when users are claiming their art allows malicious user to bypass signature/merkle hash to provide unapproved `ref_`, `artId_` and `imageURI`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/73)
*Submitted by [rscodes](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/73), also found by [gregom](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/383), [MrValioBg](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/186), [McToady](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/144), and [MrPotatoMagic](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/96)*

In the file `PhiFactory.sol`, the lack of checks in `merkleClaim` allows malicious users to bypass the hash check to pass in their own parameter of choice. The 3 variables that could possibly be manipulated (`referral`, `artId` and `imageURI`) and their impact will be each discussed below.

### Missing `ref_` and `artId_` in validation.

As we can see in [`merkleClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L362-L375), `address ref_` and `uint256 artId_` is decoded from `encodeData_` which is simply a bytes data type passed into the function parameter by the user.

```solidity
  (address minter_, address ref_, uint256 artId_) = abi.decode(encodeData_, (address, address, uint256));
  PhiArt storage art = arts[artId_];
  ......
  if (
      !MerkleProofLib.verifyCalldata(
          proof_, credMerkleRootHash, keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(minter_, leafPart_))))
      )
  ) {
      revert InvalidMerkleProof();
  }
  ......
```

Observing the line where the merkle hash is cross-checked:

```solidity
!MerkleProofLib.verifyCalldata( proof_, credMerkleRootHash, keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(minter_, leafPart_)))) )
```

It becomes clear that **only** `minter_` from `encodeData_` is checked, leaving `ref_` and `artId_` to whatever values passed by the user.

By the way, **both** `ref_` and `artId_` are **explicitly checked in the `signatureClaim` function**:

```solidity
function signatureClaim(.....) external payable whenNotPaused {
  (uint256 expiresIn_, address minter_, address ref_, address verifier_, uint256 artId_,, bytes32 data_) =
      abi.decode(encodeData_, (uint256, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes32));
      
  if (expiresIn_ <= block.timestamp) revert SignatureExpired();
  if (_recoverSigner(keccak256(encodeData_), signature_) != phiSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();
  .....
}
```

Hence, to forge `ref_` and `artId_`, malicious users will have to use `merkleClaim` instead of `signatureClaim`.

**Impact of forging `ref_`**

- Malicious users can pass in their own other account address as `ref_`, successfully stealing the referral fee from the real `ref_` or the artist(who will receive the referral fee if `ref_` is set to null).
- Suppose Alice has 2 accounts, when she calls `merkleClaim` to claim on `account 1`, she can pass in `account 2` as the `ref_` to illegally steal the referral fees to offset the cost of minting.
- The reason why Alice has to pass in `account 2` instead of `account 1` as the `ref_` is because in `PhiRewards.sol`'s `depositRewards`, referral has to be different from minter address in order for Alice to receive the referral fees.

**Impact of forging `artId_`**

- Unlike `signatureClaim` which checks `artId_` explicitly, `merkleClaim` only verifies `minter_` and `leafPart_` to the credId's merkle root hash.
- Since a Cred can have multiple art linked to it, this becomes a problem.
- Suppose `Cred A` has `Art 1` and `Art 2`.
- Now, Alice got approval to claim `Art 1`.
- If the art's verification type was set to "SIGNATURE" and Alice had to call `signatureClaim`, Alice would **only** be able to claim `Art 1` with that approval signature.
- However if the art's verification type was "MERKLE" instead, when she calls `merkleClaim`, she will be able to claim `Art 2` with only approval for `Art 1` by passing the `artId_` of `Art 2`.

### Missing `imageURI` in validation

We can see in both `signatureClaim` [Line 330](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L330) and `merkleClaim` [Line 355](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L355), `imageURI` is passed into the function parameter rather than extracted from the signature and is not involved in the merkle hash check as well.

Since `imageURI` contains important information about the art details (such as location/directory). This could have a severe impact. When the malicious user is trying to claim an art that he has permission to, he could pass in an `imageURI` with the location directory of the picture image file pointing to another art which he does not have permission for.

The line `advancedTokenURI[tokenId_][to_] = imageURI_;` in `PhiNFT1155.sol` will also be set to an unapproved value. This will lead to undefined/unsupported behaviours when interacting with the smart contract regarding trying to render an user's art URI.

### Proof of concept

Add this function to `test/PhiFactory.t.sol:TestPhiFactory`:

```solidity

  bytes32 expectedRoot = 0xe70e719557c28ce2f2f3545d64c633728d70fbcfe6ae3db5fa01420573e0f34b;
  bytes memory credData = abi.encode(1, owner, "MERKLE", 31_337, expectedRoot);
  bytes memory signCreateData = abi.encode(expiresIn, ART_ID_URL_STRING, credData);
  bytes32 createMsgHash = keccak256(signCreateData);
  bytes32 createDigest = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(createMsgHash);
  (uint8 cv, bytes32 cr, bytes32 cs) = vm.sign(claimSignerPrivateKey, createDigest);
  if (cv != 27) cs = cs | bytes32(uint256(1) << 255);

  address Alice = participant; //Original file setup already deals `participant` enough ether to pay for mint fees
  address Alice_2 = address(0x123456); //Alice's account 2
  vm.startPrank(Alice);

  bytes32[] memory proof = new bytes32[](2);
  proof[0] = 0x0927f012522ebd33191e00fe62c11db25288016345e12e6b63709bb618d777d4;

  (, bytes memory response) = phiFactory.phiRewardsAddress().call(abi.encodeWithSignature("balanceOf(address)", Alice_2));
  uint256 balance = abi.decode(response, (uint256));
  console2.log("Alice_2: ", balance); //Alice successfully illegally receives referral fee through her second account
  vm.stopPrank();
}
```

Run `forge test --match-test test_claimHack -vv`:

```
Ran 1 test for test/PhiFactory.t.sol:TestPhiFactory
[PASS] test_claimHack() (gas: 1356967)

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 14.83ms (4.52ms CPU time)
```

As you can see from the Code and the output, `Alice` managed to set the referral address to her second account (`Alice_2`), and received the referral reward of `0.00005 ether`; which will be a significant sum if Alice was minting high quantity of art, since rewards are calculated by `quantity_ * referralReward`

Alice also managed to **manipulate image_uri**, encoding `IMAGE_URL2` instead of `IMAGE_URL` into the function parameter. Both `IMAGE_URL2` and `IMAGE_URL` are different variables which are already declared in the original foundry test file.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In function `merkleClaim`:

```diff
if (
    !MerkleProofLib.verifyCalldata(
-       proof_, credMerkleRootHash, keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(minter_, leafPart_))))
+       proof_, credMerkleRootHash, keccak256(bytes.concat(keccak256(abi.encode(minter_, ref_, artId_, mintArgs_.imageURI, leafPart_))))
  )
) {
    revert InvalidMerkleProof();
}
```

In function `signatureClaim`:

```diff
-  (uint256 expiresIn_, address minter_, address ref_, address verifier_, uint256 artId_,, bytes32 data_) = abi.decode(encodeData_, (uint256, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes32));
+  (uint256 expiresIn_, address minter_, address ref_, address verifier_, uint256 artId_,, bytes32 data_, string memory uri) = abi.decode(encodeData_, (uint256, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes32, string));
+  mintArgs_.imageURI = uri;
```

## [[M-06] PhiNFT1155 contracts continue sending fees/royalties to old protocol destination address](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/57)
*Submitted by [MrPotatoMagic](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/57), also found by [hgrano](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/372), [20centclub](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/238), [0xNirix](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/161), and [0xCiphky](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi-findings/issues/12)*

When a PhiNFT1155.sol contract instance is created from the PhiFactory contract, the `initialize()` function is called to setup it. One of the parameters passed along is the `protocolFeeDestination` address, which is used as the default royalty recipient (see [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol#L109)) and the address that will receive the `artCreate` fees (see [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol#L144)).

### Issue

The issue is that if the `protocolFeeDestinationAddress` contract is changed in the PhiFactory contract by the owner using function [`setProtocolFeeDestination()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L411), the existing PhiNFT1155.sol contract instances created would still be using the old protocol fee destination address stored in them since it is not being dynamically retrieved from the PhiFactory contract. The `protocolFeeDestination` address could be updated for several reasons such as in case it is compromised, becomes malicious or there has been a decision made to make the address non-privileged.

### Impact

Due to this, the old protocol fee destination address would still be receiving all the royalties (i.e., `500 bps = 5%`) from all PhiNFT1155.sol contract instances. It would also be receiving all the `artCreateFee` amount of tokens when art is created through the [`createArtFromFactory()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/art/PhiNFT1155.sol#L138) function.

### Proof of Concept

1. First we'll take a look at the `protocolFeeDestination` address. As we can see below, once the `protocolFeeDestination` address is set through the `initialize()` function on Line 122, there is no way to update it to the new address or no way to dynamically retrieve the latest address from the PhiFactory contract.

```solidity
File: PhiNFT1155.sol
43:     address public protocolFeeDestination;

... ...

File: PhiNFT1155.sol
095:     function initialize(
096:         uint256 credChainId_,
097:         uint256 credId_,
098:         string memory verificationType_,
099:         address protocolFeeDestination_
100:     )
101:         external
102:         initializer
103:     {
104:         ...

109:         initializeRoyalties(protocolFeeDestination_);
110: 
111:         ...

120:         phiFactoryContract = IPhiFactory(payable(msg.sender));
121: 
122:         protocolFeeDestination = phiFactoryContract.protocolFeeDestination(); 
123:         ...
126:     }
```

2. Now let's say the owner of the PhiFactory contract calls the `setProtocolFeeDestination()` function to update the `protocolFeeDestination` address in case the address is compromised, malicious or there has been a decision made to make the address non-privileged.

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
426:     function setProtocolFeeDestination(address protocolFeeDestination_)
427:         external
428:         nonZeroAddress(protocolFeeDestination_)
429:         onlyOwner
430:     {
431:         protocolFeeDestination = protocolFeeDestination_;
432:         emit ProtocolFeeDestinationSet(protocolFeeDestination_);
433:     }
```

3. Now although the address has changed, the PhiNFT1155.sol contracts, which inherit the CreatorRoyaltiesControl.sol contract, still return the configuration `royaltyRecipient` as the old address when `royaltyInfo()` function is called (which is used by external marketplaces). This is because when `initializeRoyalties()` was called, it permanently set the `royaltyRecipient` equal to the old protocol fee destination address. Since `royaltyRecipient` does not dynamically retrieve the latest value through the factory, the royalties are paid to the old address.

```solidity
File: CreatorRoyaltiesControl.sol
17:     function initializeRoyalties(address _royaltyRecipient) internal {
18:         if (_royaltyRecipient == address(0)) revert InvalidRoyaltyRecipient();
19:         if (initialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();
20:         royaltyRecipient = _royaltyRecipient;
21:         initialized = true;
22:     }

... ...

43:     function royaltyInfo(
44:         uint256 tokenId,
45:         uint256 salePrice
46:     )
47:         public
48:         view
49:         returns (address receiver, uint256 royaltyAmount)
50:     {
51:         RoyaltyConfiguration memory config = getRoyalties(tokenId);
52:         royaltyAmount = (config.royaltyBPS * salePrice) / ROYALTY_BPS_TO_PERCENT;
53:         receiver = config.royaltyRecipient;
54:     }
```

4. Secondly, when multiple art creations occur through functions [`_createNewNFTContract()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L620) and [`_useExistingNFTContract()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L651) in the PhiFactory contract, it calls the `createArtFromFactory()` function in the respective PhiNFT1155.sol contracts. Over here as we can see below, the `artCreateFee` is still sent to the old `protocolFeeDestination` address.

```solidity
File: PhiNFT1155.sol
139:     function createArtFromFactory(uint256 artId_) external payable onlyPhiFactory whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
140:         ...
143: 
144:         uint256 artFee = phiFactoryContract.artCreateFee();
145: 
146:         protocolFeeDestination.safeTransferETH(artFee);
147:         
             ...
159:     }
```

5. To note, if the old `protocolFeeDestination` address is a contract implementation that turns out to be malicious (which could be one of the reasons why it is being replaced), it can revert in its fallback function to DOS art creations from factory for a credential; i.e., `credId`. This impact is unlikely to occur since in most cases the fee destination would be an EOA. But the impacts mentioned in step 3 and 4 would be troublesome since all the existing PhiNFT1155.sol contracts would still be sending all the royalties and art creation fees to it.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

To solve the issue in CreatorRoyaltiesControl, consider retrieving the default royalty recipient variable dynamically from the phiFactory contract. The same would also need to be applied to the `protocolFeeDestination` address currently stored in the PhiNFT1155.sol contract.

Using dynamic retrieval from the factory would solve the issue for all PhiNFT1155.sol contract instances that were created.

The Cred.sol contract provides a `buyShareCredFor()` function which anyone can use to buy shares for another curator. We also know that once a share is bought, the curator needs to serve a 10 minute share lock period before being able to sell those tokens.

### Impact

The issue is that an attacker can purchase 1 share every 10 minutes on behalf of the curator to DOS them from selling. As we can see on the bonding share price curve docs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wHi9Mqo9YU8EUMQuUvuC75Dav6NSY5LOw-iDlkrZEA/edit?pli=1\&gid=859106557#gid=859106557), the price to buy 1 share starts from 2.46 USD and barely increases. Each share bought = 10 minutes of delay for the victim user.

Delaying the user from selling is not the only problem though. During these delays, the price of the share can drop, which could ruin a user's trade strategy causing to incur more loss.

### Proof of Concept

Refer to the price curve [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wHi9Mqo9YU8EUMQuUvuC75Dav6NSY5LOw-iDlkrZEA/edit?pli=1\&gid=859106557#gid=859106557) for cost of shares.

1. Let's assume 30 shares have been bought already by users A, B and C (we ignore the 1 share given to the creator). The shares were bought in order, i.e., 10 first by A, then B and then C. This means A bought 10 shares for 25 USD, B for 30 USD and C for 35 USD. The price of 1 share currently is 4 USD as per the price curve after all buys.
2. Let's say A and C hold the shares for a bit longer while B is looking to sell them as soon as possible to profit from C's buy that increased the price.
3. Now let's say the attacker calls function `buyShareCredFor()` with user B as the curator. This would be done close to the end of the 10 minute share lock period of user B.

```solidity
File: Cred.sol
186:     function buyShareCredFor(uint256 credId_, uint256 amount_, address curator_, uint256 maxPrice_) public payable {
187:         if (curator_ == address(0)) revert InvalidAddressZero();
188:         _handleTrade(credId_, amount_, true, curator_, maxPrice_);
189:     }
```

4. When the attacker's call goes through to the internal function `_handleTrade()`, the `lastTradeTimestamp` is updated for the user B. This means B has to serve the share lock period all over again for 10 minutes. Note that this would provide user B with 1 more share (which costs the attacker 4 USD).

```solidity
File: Cred.sol
642:         if (isBuy) {
643:             cred.currentSupply += amount_;
644:             ...
649:             lastTradeTimestamp[credId_][curator_] = block.timestamp;
```

5. User B tries to sell but isn't able to due to the share lock period check in `_handleTrade()`.

```solidity
File: Cred.sol
629:             if (block.timestamp <= lastTradeTimestamp[credId_][curator_] + SHARE_LOCK_PERIOD) {
630:                 revert ShareLockPeriodNotPassed(
631:                     block.timestamp, lastTradeTimestamp[credId_][curator_] + SHARE_LOCK_PERIOD
632:                 );
633:             }
```

6. Users C and A sell their shares of the `credId` during this period for 36 USD and 31 USD respectively. This brings the price per share down to 2.57 USD, which for user B would mean 25.7 USD. This means user B lost 4.3 USD approximately from the initial buy.
7. Note that user C could also have been the attacker where the net loss of the attacker; i.e., C would result to `4 USD - (final sell amount - initial purchase amount) = 4 USD - (36 USD - 35 USD) = 3 USD`.
8. Overall in addition to grief DOSing a user from selling, other users are able to alter another user's strategy by preventing them from selling.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider removing the `buyShareCredFor()` function since it does more harm than good.

 > This scenario works only in a sandbox environment where users A and C are aware of the trading intentions of user B. The gradual increase/decrease of signal prices is a protocol design as per the curation [price spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wHi9Mqo9YU8EUMQuUvuC75Dav6NSY5LOw-iDlkrZEA/edit?pli=1&gid=859106557#gid=859106557), meaning users engaging in signal trading are aware that their signals can appreciate/depreciate with each transaction. User B's signals depreciating in price due to A and C's sells is an intended design, regardless if a timelock is imposed or not. One could argue that a whale signal holder could dump their signals when other curators buy from the same cred - this is still not a vulnerability, it's rules of the game and it also relies on the prerequisite that users willingly bought signals in a cred where there is a whale holder.

> The issue isn't talking about the intended design of a timelock being imposed. The whole point of the issue is that other users should not be able to extend someone else's existing share lock period. Surely users have to do their due diligence while taking a trade knowing that there would be the original timelock of 10 minutes imposed by their "own trade". But they're not aware beforehand that after those 10 minutes, they won't be able to sell those shares and perform their expected trade. Fundamentally, other users should not be allowed to manipulate another user's trade.

> Users are aware of this risk like in any other market. It's like you're saying I won't buy BTC cause Blackrock can dump on me. A user is looking to profit from future user buys. If someone can prevent a user from selling at any time by extending their original share lock period, that's a bug.

 > This is a valid griefing scenario. While it does involve the attacker "gifting" a share of increasing value, it temporarily locks someone's funds. Higher level, this verges into "market manipulation" as anyone is able to prop up the market by prohibiting sales. Also, imagine if an exploit occurs or a zero-day vulnerability is leaked. Blocking user withdrawals for even 10 minutes will have severe impact. Given that such an example is low likelihood, this will remain as Medium.

The [`_processClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L723) internal function is responsible for calling the `claimFromFactory` function in the art contract, transferring the protocol fees to the `protocolFeeDestination`, and handling any applicable refunds.

```solidity
    function _processClaim(
        ...
    )
        private
    {
        PhiArt storage art = arts[artId_];

        // Handle refund
        uint256 mintFee = getArtMintFee(artId_, quantity_);
        if ((etherValue_ - mintFee) > 0) {
            _msgSender().safeTransferETH(etherValue_ - mintFee);
        }
        protocolFeeDestination.safeTransferETH(mintProtocolFee * quantity_);

        (bool success_,) = art.artAddress.call{ value: mintFee - mintProtocolFee * quantity_ }(
            abi.encodeWithSignature(
                "claimFromFactory(uint256,address,address,address,uint256,bytes32,string)",
                artId_,
                minter_,
                ref_,
                verifier_,
                quantity_,
                data_,
                imageURI_
            )
        );

        if (!success_) revert ClaimFailed();
    }
```

When a user sends excess funds (`msg.value`) over the required `mintFee`, the difference is intended to be refunded to the user. This works as expected when the [`signatureClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L327) or [`merkleClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L352) functions are called directly in the PhiFactory contract by the user since `msg.sender` is the correct address (User). However, in some cases refunds are sent to the wrong address.

### Case 1: `Claim` function and `batchClaim` function

In the [`batchClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L308) function, multiple claims are processed by calling the claim function with `this` (the current contract) as the caller, resulting in the `msg.sender` being the PhiFactory contract rather than the actual user.

```solidity
    function batchClaim(bytes[] calldata encodeDatas_, uint256[] calldata ethValue_) external payable {
        if (encodeDatas_.length != ethValue_.length) revert ArrayLengthMismatch();

        // calc claim fee
        uint256 totalEthValue;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodeDatas_.length; i++) {
            totalEthValue = totalEthValue + ethValue_[i];
        }
        if (msg.value != totalEthValue) revert InvalidEthValue();

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < encodeDatas_.length; i++) {
            this.claim{ value: ethValue_[i] }(encodeDatas_[i]);
        }
    }
```

Similarly, the [`claim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L264) function also uses `this` when calling either the `signatureClaim` or `merkleClaim` functions, further propagating the incorrect `msg.sender` value. Consequently, any refunds are sent to the PhiFactory contract instead of the actual user, causing an incorrect refund.

### Case 2: `signatureClaim` function and `merkleClaim` function in the Claimable contract

The [`signatureClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/abstract/Claimable.sol#L22) and [`merkleClaim`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/abstract/Claimable.sol#L47) functions are also callable through the Claimable contract, which is part of the PhiNFT1155 contract. However, like in the previous case, the `msg.sender` will be incorrect being the PhiNFT1155 contract itself, rather than the actual user who initiated the call. This results in refunds being directed to the PhiNFT1155 contract rather than the user. In this case, funds are also not able to be pulled out by the owner, effectively locking them in the contract.

### Impact

- Incorrect handling of `msg.sender` results in refunds being sent to contracts (PhiFactory or PhiNFT1155) rather than the intended users.
- While the loss of funds due to overpayment is more of a user error, the primary concern here is that the intended logic for refunding users is incorrect which was specifically mentioned by the protocol to look out for.
    - **Function Reliability:** Ensure the contract behaves consistently under various conditions.
    - **Function Correctness:** Ensure the smart contract logic correctly implements the intended functionality without errors.
    [Reference](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi?tab=readme-ov-file#attack-ideas-where-to-focus-for-bugs)

### Proof Of Concept

```solidity
    function test_claim_1155_refund() public {
        // SET UP
        vm.warp(START_TIME + 1);
        uint256 artId = 1;
        address artAddress = phiFactory.getArtAddress(artId);
        vm.warp(START_TIME + 2);
        bytes memory data = _createSigSignData(true);
        bytes memory payload = abi.encodePacked(abi.encodeWithSignature("`signatureClaim()`"), data);
        // SET UP
        // Check 1155 contract ETH balance before
        assertEq(address(artAddress).balance, 0 ether);
        // send mint fee plus extra 0.1 ETH
        vm.startPrank(participant, participant);
        (bool success,) = artAddress.call{ value: phiFactory.getArtMintFee(artId, 1) + 0.1 ether }(payload);
        require(success, "1155 artAddress.call failed");

        // Check 1155 contract ETH balance, refund sent here instead
        assertEq(address(artAddress).balance, 0.1 ether);
    }
```

### Recommendation

Modify the affected functions (`batchClaim`, `claim`, `signatureClaim`, and `merkleClaim`) to pass the original user address as a parameter. This way, the function can handle refunds correctly by transferring excess funds to the correct user.

The report consists of low-severity risk issues, governance risk issues arising from centralization vectors and a few non-critical issues in the end. The governance risks section describes scenarios in which the actors could misuse their powers.

## Low-severity issues

## [L-01] `RewardsDeposit` and `Deposit` events can be spam emitted with 0 value deposits through external function `handleRewardsAndGetValueSent()`

The `handleRewardsAndGetValueSent()` function is called from the PhiNFT1155.sol contracts deployed. This function currently is externally exposed which means events can be spam emitted by directly calling the function. These emission is possible by passing quantity as 0 and `msg.value` as 0. Performing this spam is easy on low fee chains that the protocol is currently planning to deploy on.

This is also an attack idea mentioned in the README - "Are there any potential issues with emitting events or executing functions when using Decent or relayer protocols?" and "Does the contract emit all necessary events correctly and include appropriate data?". Since we do not know how the events are going to be used by relayer protocols due to being out of scope, the issue is being submitted as QA.

            quantity_ * referralReward,
            quantity_ * verifierReward,
            quantity_ * curateReward,
            chainSync_
        );
    }
```

The `depositRewards()` function from PhiRewards contract above calls the `deposit()` function in the CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol contract, which would also spam emit the `Deposit` events. 

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 credId, uint256 amount) external payable {
        if (!credContract.isExist(credId)) revert InvalidCredId();
        if (msg.value != amount) {
            revert InvalidValue(msg.value, amount);
        }
        balanceOf[credId] += amount;
        emit Deposit(credId, amount);
    }
```

### Solution

Consider adding a check in the `handleRewardsAndGetValueSent()` and `deposit()` function, which disallows calls if `quantity = 0` or `amount = 0`. 

## [L-02] Function `distribute()` in CuratorRewardsDistributor is prone to frontrunning

In the CuratorRewardsDistributor contract, any user can call the `distribute()` function through the frontend (as seen on the [demo site](https://base-sepolia.terminal.phiprotocol.xyz/cred/137)). The user would earn 1% (currently) of the total balance as the royalty reward.

The issue is that all `distribute()` function calls occurring from the frontend would be made by normal users, which a bot can frontrun by calling the `distribute()` function itself. This means normal users would never be able to receive royalty fees.

### Solution

A good way to solve this is by implementing some minimum requirement. E.g., only users who have been holding shares of that credId for a certain duration would be able to call `distribute()`. 

```solidity
File: CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol
081:     function distribute(uint256 credId) external {
082:         if (!credContract.isExist(credId)) revert InvalidCredId();
083:         uint256 totalBalance = balanceOf[credId];
084:         
             ...

103:         uint256 royaltyfee = (totalBalance * withdrawRoyalty) / RATIO_BASE;
104:         
             ...
122: 
123:         balanceOf[credId] -= totalBalance;
124: 
125:         _msgSender().safeTransferETH(royaltyfee + distributeAmount - actualDistributeAmount);
126: 
127:         ...
131: 
132:         ...
135:     }
```

## [L-03] Malicious user can game curator rewards distribution model in certain conditions

### Context

The `distribute()` function in CuratorRewardsDistributor distributes curator rewards accumulated through different artId mints under a `credId`. The `balanceOf[credId]` is distributed to users who hold non-zero amount of shares of that `credId`.

### Issue

A malicious user could frontrun a `distribute(credId)` function call to buy a huge amount of shares of that `credId`. This would put the user into the curator addresses list that is eligible to receive the rewards.

If we check lines 114-115 in the snippet below, we can see that it uses the shares of a curator and divides it by the total number of shares to determine the `%` of `distributeAmount` to give to the curator. Since the malicious user frontran the `distribute()` call by buying a large amount of shares, the rewards would be diluted and distributed when the `distribute()` function call goes through. 

Through this, we can see that although the malicious user just bought the shares, the user is immediately eligible for the curator rewards. Many malicious users could exploit this opportunity to earn a good chunk of `distributeAmount`.

To note, there is obviously the 10 minute share lock period that the malicious user will have to adhere to, during which some curators can sell to profit from the malicious user's buy that increased the price. Since there is a tradeoff introduced with the 10 minute delay, the net profit an attacker could make through this won't be much but the possibility still exists since previous curators may not sell.

### Solution

Introduce a minimum time period, e.g., 10 minutes required before being eligible for curator reward distribution. 

```solidity
File: CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol
081:     function distribute(uint256 credId) external {
082:         if (!credContract.isExist(credId)) revert InvalidCredId();
083:         uint256 totalBalance = balanceOf[credId];
084:         
             ...

089:         address[] memory distributeAddresses = credContract.getCuratorAddresses(credId, 0, 0);
090:         uint256 totalNum;
091: 
092:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < distributeAddresses.length; i++) {
093:             totalNum += credContract.getShareNumber(credId, distributeAddresses[i]);
094:         }
095: 
096:         ...
099: 
100:         uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](distributeAddresses.length);
101:         
             ...
105: 
106:         // actualDistributeAmount is used to avoid rounding errors
107:         // amount[0] = 333 333 333 333 333 333
108:         // amount[1] = 333 333 333 333 333 333
109:         // amount[2] = 333 333 333 333 333 333
110:         uint256 actualDistributeAmount = 0;
111:         for (uint256 i = 0; i < distributeAddresses.length; i++) {
112:             address user = distributeAddresses[i];
113: 
114:             uint256 userAmounts = credContract.getShareNumber(credId, user);
115:             uint256 userRewards = (distributeAmount * userAmounts) / totalNum;
116: 
117:             if (userRewards > 0) {
118:                 amounts[i] = userRewards;
119:                 actualDistributeAmount += userRewards;
120:             }
121:         }
             ...
135:     }
```

## [L-04] Creator does not receive fees when `supply = 0`

Creator does not receive creator fees when `supply = 0`, which is for the initial case when a share is bought during cred creation. This is an issue since the `msg.sender` that receives the first share can be a party other than the creator supplied in the cred that is being created.

Overall, the value lost is negligible and poses a QA risk. 

```solidity
File: BondingCurve.sol
51:     function getPriceData(
52:         uint256 credId_,
53:         uint256 supply_,
54:         uint256 amount_,
55:         bool isSign_
56:     )
57:         public
58:         view
59:         returns (uint256 price, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 creatorFee)
60:     {
61:         (uint16 buyShareRoyalty, uint16 sellShareRoyalty) = credContract.getCreatorRoyalty(credId_);
62: 
63:         price = isSign_ ? getPrice(supply_, amount_) : getPrice(supply_ - amount_, amount_);
64: 
65:       
66:         protocolFee = _getProtocolFee(price);
67:         
68:         if (supply_ == 0) {
69:             creatorFee = 0;
70:             return (price, protocolFee, creatorFee);
71:         }
72:         uint16 royaltyRate = isSign_ ? buyShareRoyalty : sellShareRoyalty;
73:         creatorFee = (price * royaltyRate) / RATIO_BASE;
74:     }
```

## [L-05] Missing receiver address validation during `artId` creation in `_initializePhiArt()` could DOS future claiming

When an `artId` is being created, the `_initializeArt()` function is called as part of the process. In this function the receiver address is stored in the PhiArt struct. The issue is that this address is not validated to not be `address(0)`.

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
642:     function _initializePhiArt(PhiArt storage art, ERC1155Data memory createData_) private {
643:         (
644:             uint256 credId,
645:             address credCreator,
646:             string memory verificationType,
647:             uint256 credChainId,
648:             bytes32 merkleRootHash
649:         ) = abi.decode(createData_.credData, (uint256, address, string, uint256, bytes32));
650: 
651:         ...
658:         art.receiver = createData_.receiver;
659:         ...
```

Due to this, during merkle or signature claiming from factory, the call would revert. This is because the `handleRewardsAndGetValueSent()` function calls the `depositRewards()` function that expects the receiver address of the artist to be non-zero as seen [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/reward/PhiRewards.sol#L93).

```solidity
  function claimFromFactory(
        uint256 artId_,
        address minter_,
        address ref_,
        address verifier_,
        uint256 quantity_,
        bytes32 data_,
        string calldata imageURI_
    )
        external
        payable
        whenNotPaused
        onlyPhiFactory
    {
        ...

        IPhiRewards(payable(phiFactoryContract.phiRewardsAddress())).handleRewardsAndGetValueSent{ value: msg.value }(
            artId_, credId, quantity_, mintFee(tokenId_), addressesData_, credChainId == block.chainid
        );
    }
```

### Solution

Add the zero address check during `artId` creation, i.e., in `_initializePhiArt()` function.

## [L-06] PhiNFT1155.sol contract will not be upgradeable contrary to documentation

According to the docs [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/main/docs/overview.md#upgradeability) on upgradeability, the PhiNFT1155 contracts use the UUPS upgradeability pattern and can be upgraded by the owner.

Currently though, it is not possible to upgrade them since `msg.sender` has to be the owner, which would be the factory contract and the factory contract does not have a mechanism to upgrade contracts, i.e., call the upgrade functionality in the UUPSUpgradeable contract inherited by PhiNFT1155.

It's not clear how the factory contract could have and support multiple implementation contracts of PhiNFT1155 (since many contracts can be created through function [`createArt()`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/PhiFactory.sol#L196) in the PhiFactory contract). If upgradeability needs to be supported, introduce a proxy for each PhiNFT1155 contract deployed and a mechanism upgrade it through the factory. If not, correct the documentation. 

```solidity
File: PhiNFT1155.sol
366:     function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner {
367:         // This function is intentionally left empty to allow for upgrades
368:     }
```

## [L-07] Attacker can use function `withdrawFor()` to DOS users from withdrawing

Attacker can frontrun a user's `withdraw()` or `withdrawWithSig()` function full balance withdrawals with small `withdrawFor()` calls to grief users. For example, if user A tries to withdraw 100 tokens using function `withdraw()` or `withdrawWithSig()`, the attacker can frontrun and withdraw a 1 wei amount using function `withdrawFor()`. This would cause A's call to revert since now only 100 - 1 wei amount of tokens are withdrawable. 

Another issue that arises is that the `withdrawFor()` function defaults the destination to the "from" address. This is an issue since if the "from" address cannot deal with withdrawing `msg.value` (which is unlikely though) or if the user wanted to withdraw to another address, the tokens could be stuck in the "from" address contract or just simply sent to the "from" address EOA that was not supposed to receive the tokens. Due to this, an attacker is able to force a withdrawal to the "from" address. 

### Solution

Introduce an allowance system for function `withdrawFor()`. 

```solidity
File: RewardControl.sol
101:     function withdrawFor(address from, uint256 amount) external {
102:         _withdraw(from, from, amount);
103:     }
```

## [L-08] Royalties would round down to 0 when the unit of exchange has low decimals

Note: Low decimal tokens are in scope as per the [README](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi#erc20-token-behaviors-in-scope).

In CreatorRoyaltiesControl.sol contract (which is inherited by PhiNFT1155.sol contract), rounding down of royalties is possible if `salePrice` is denominated in a token that has low decimals. 

For example, `royaltybps = 10` (i.e. 0.1%) and `salePrice = up to 999` (meaning up to 0.999 tokens for a token with two decimals). When we perform calculations, the `royaltyAmount` would be returned as `10 * 999 (max) / 10000 = 9990/10000 = 0`. 

According to [EIP 2981](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2981):

> If the royalty fee calculation results in a remainder, implementers MAY round up or round down to the nearest integer. For example, if the royalty fee is 10% and `_salePrice` is 999, the implementer can return either 99 or 100 for `royaltyAmount`, both are valid.

This is optional to the protocol as mentioned by the spec but since it could result in the royalties not being received by the artist, it is a valid issue to consider.

Note we can also see the IERC2981 inherited contract in CreatorRoyaltiesControl.sol which mentions: 

> Returns how much royalty is owed and to whom, based on a sale price that may be denominated in any unit of exchange. The royalty amount is denominated and should be paid in that same unit of exchange.

This further proves that the contract is supposed to support and return royalties in any unit of exchange requested by an external marketplace, which isn't currently done. 

```solidity
File: CreatorRoyaltiesControl.sol
43:     function royaltyInfo(
44:         uint256 tokenId,
45:         uint256 salePrice
46:     )
47:         public
48:         view
49:         returns (address receiver, uint256 royaltyAmount)
50:     {
51:         RoyaltyConfiguration memory config = getRoyalties(tokenId);
52:         royaltyAmount = (config.royaltyBPS * salePrice) / ROYALTY_BPS_TO_PERCENT;
53:         receiver = config.royaltyRecipient;
54:     }
```

## [L-09] Consider using `<` instead of `<=` for expiry checks

Consider using `<` instead of `<=` on Line 625 below. From the frontend, we might just want the signature to be valid for the current block. So we just use `block.timestamp` but currently it requires `expiresIn` to be greater than `block.timestamp`.

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
622:     function _validateArtCreationSignature(bytes calldata signedData_, bytes calldata signature_) private view {
623:         if (_recoverSigner(keccak256(signedData_), signature_) != phiSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();
624:         (uint256 expiresIn_,,) = abi.decode(signedData_, (uint256, string, bytes));
625:         if (expiresIn_ <= block.timestamp) revert SignatureExpired();
626:         
627:     }
```

A similar instance also exists in the function ``signatureClaim()`` in the phiFactory.sol contract and `createCred()` function in the Cred.sol contract.

## [L-10] Old signatures supplied would become invalid and DOS art creation if `phiSignerAddress` is changed

During creation of art, we verify that the `signedData`, i.e., `credId` and uri supplied is validated by the `phiSignerAddress` before providing the signature. This signature is then verified onchain as seen in the function below. The issue is that if the `phiSignerAddress` is updated through the setter, the latest signatures issues would cause a revert during art creation since Line 623 would evaluate to true.

Although this works as intended and users can simply take new signatures from the new `phiSignerAddress`, it is an edge case worth looking into to avoid unnecessary latest signature failures when a `phiSignerAddress` is changed. 

### Solution

Before supplying signatures from the frontend, ensure the `phiSignerAddress` has not been updated onchain. If updated, supply signature through the frontend provided the new `phiSignerAddress` is configured. 

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
622:     function _validateArtCreationSignature(bytes calldata signedData_, bytes calldata signature_) private view {
623:         if (_recoverSigner(keccak256(signedData_), signature_) != phiSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();
624:         (uint256 expiresIn_,,) = abi.decode(signedData_, (uint256, string, bytes));
625:         if (expiresIn_ <= block.timestamp) revert SignatureExpired();
626:         
627:     }
```

## [L-11] Function `signatureClaim()` does not check if verification type is SIGNATURE

Unlike `merkleClaim()`, function `signatureClaim()` does not check if the verification type of the artId being minted is SIGNATURE or not. This is in case the function is directly called and not through the `claim()` function. 

Although I'm assuming the `phiSignerAddress` will be providing signatures for the `encodedData_` only for signature verification types, it would be good to add the check as done in `merkleClaim()`. 

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
344:     function signatureClaim(
345:         bytes calldata signature_,
346:         bytes calldata encodeData_,
347:         MintArgs calldata mintArgs_
348:     )
349:         external
350:         payable
351:         whenNotPaused
352:     {
353:         (uint256 expiresIn_, address minter_, address ref_, address verifier_, uint256 artId_,, bytes32 data_) =
354:             abi.decode(encodeData_, (uint256, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes32));
355: 
356:      
357:         if (expiresIn_ <= block.timestamp) revert SignatureExpired();
358:         if (_recoverSigner(keccak256(encodeData_), signature_) != phiSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();
359:         
360:        
361:         _validateAndUpdateClaimState(artId_, minter_, mintArgs_.quantity);
362:         _processClaim(artId_, minter_, ref_, verifier_, mintArgs_.quantity, data_, mintArgs_.imageURI, msg.value);
363:       
365:         emit ArtClaimedData(artId_, "SIGNATURE", minter_, ref_, verifier_, arts[artId_].artAddress, mintArgs_.quantity);
366:     }
```

## [L-12] Missing `whenNotPaused()` modifier on function `updateArtSettings()`

Missing `whenNotPaused()` modifier on `updateArtSettings()` allows any artist to update their art settings when the contract is paused. Although there does not seem to be a risk currently, it should be disallowed if the factory itself is paused. 

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
227:     function updateArtSettings(
228:         uint256 artId_,
229:         string memory url_,
230:         address receiver_,
231:         uint256 maxSupply_,
232:         uint256 mintFee_,
233:         uint256 startTime_,
234:         uint256 endTime_,
235:         bool soulBounded_,
236:         IPhiNFT1155Ownable.RoyaltyConfiguration memory configuration
237:     )
238:         external
239:         onlyArtCreator(artId_)
240:     {
```

## [L-13] A removed bonding curve would still be used by previously created creds

A bonding curve can be removed from the whitelist using the function `removeFromWhitelist()`. The issue is that previously created creds keep on using the old bonding curves that have been removed from the system.

It's not clear whether previous creds using the old bonding curves should continue to operate if a the curve is removed, due to which this is being submitted as a QA risk. 

```solidity
File: Cred.sol
164:     function addToWhitelist(address address_) external onlyOwner {
165:         curatePriceWhitelist[address_] = true;
166:         emit AddedToWhitelist(_msgSender(), address_);
167:     }
168: 
169:     /// @notice Removes an address from the whitelist.
170:     /// @param address_ The address to remove from the whitelist.
171:     function removeFromWhitelist(address address_) external onlyOwner {
172:         curatePriceWhitelist[address_] = false;
173:         emit RemovedFromWhitelist(_msgSender(), address_);
174:     }
```

## [L-14] Normal users are always prone to incurring a loss in Cred.sol due to MEV

Normal users are always prone to incurring a loss due to MEV (who the creators of a cred could themselves be or someone else). For example, user A places buy order, MEV bot frontruns buy order with its own buy order. Assuming user A is fine with price increase, the tx goes through. After 10 minutes of the share lock period, MEV bot sells shares with sell order. Unless victim user A is another MEV bot, normal users would always be incurring this loss since they would not be able to sell before the 10 minute period is over.

```solidity
File: Cred.sol
185:     function sellShareCred(uint256 credId_, uint256 amount_, uint256 minPrice_) public {
186:         _handleTrade(credId_, amount_, false, _msgSender(), minPrice_);
187:     }
```

## Governance risks

### Roles/Actors in the system

1. PhiFactory
   - Contract owner
   - `phiSignerAddress`
   - `protocolFeeDestination`
2. PhiNFT1155
   - phiFactoryContract (Contract owner)
   - `protocolFeeDestination`
   - Artists
3. PhiRewards
   - Contract owner
4. CuratorRewardsDistributor
   - Contract owner
5. Cred
   - Contract owner
   - `phiSignerAddress`
   - `protocolFeeDestination`
6. BondingCurve
   - Contract owner

### Powers of each role

1. **PhiFactory**
   - **Contract owner** - Owner has access to `pause()` and `unpause()` functionality. A malicious scenario would be where the owner pauses the contract and renounces ownership. Similarly, the owner has the power to pause the PhiNFT1155 art contracts and perform the same behaviour. It also has the power to change the `phiSignerAddress`. If `phiSignerAddress` is changed maliciously, previous signatures would become invalid, which would temporarily halt any art creation and signature claiming until new signatures are provided. Some more core functions that the owner could misuse are `setPhiRewardsAddress()`, `setErc1155ArtAddress()`, `setProtocolFeeDestination()`, `setProtocolFee()` and `setArtCreatFee()`.

   - **`phiSignerAddress`** - The `phiSignerAddress` provides signatures to create art for a `credId` and claiming for an `artId`. Importantly, it verifies the `credData` and `claimData` are correct. Specifically, for signature claiming it has the power to supply an incorrect verifier address that can receive the verifier rewards, effectively stealing from the actual verifier that was supposed to receive the fees. The same also applies for the referral rewards. Overall, it holds the power to the extent of potentially DOS claiming and art creation by not providing signatures for some users. 

   - **`protocolFeeDestination`** - This address, if a contract, can revert in its fallback function when it receives the fees through function `_processClaim()`. This could be done to favour certain users over others when claiming. 

2. **PhiNFT1155**
   - **phiFactoryContract (Contract owner)** - Ability to perform art creations, claims, pause and unpause the contract. Pausing and unpausing is indirectly influenced by the PhiFactory contract's owner. 

   - **`protocolFeeDestination`** - The `protocolFeeDestination` address receives the art create fees. It could revert (if a contract) in its fallback function when receiving the fees to deny some users from creating art for a credential, i.e., `credId`.

   - **Artists** - Artists have the power to update royalties at any time. This is true even when the contract is paused. A malicious artist has the ability to set the royalty fee to a value greater than what is being read by external marketplaces. This could be achieved by frontrunning the external marketplaces calls to `royaltyInfo()`. Since there is no rate limit imposed on updating royalties, it allows an artist to misuse this functionality. 

3. **PhiRewards**
   - **Contract owner** - Owner has the ability to determine artist, referral, verifier and curator rewards. If curator reward is set to 0, there would be no tokens to distribute through function `distribute()` in CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol contract. The owner also has the ability to update CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol contract itself. This means that if the address of that contract is changed to a malicious contract address, the owner can slowly leak curator rewards without anyone noticing. 

4. **CuratorRewardsDistributor**
   - **Contract owner** - Owner has the ability to set the `phiRewardsContract` address and the `withdrawRoyalty` distributed to the `msg.sender` of the `distribute()` function as a royalty fee. Similar to the owner of PhiRewards contract, this owner can set the phiRewardsContract to a malicious contract address. When the `depositBatch()` function call goes through the `distribute()` function, it would send all the tokens to the malicious contract address. Secondly, the owner has the ability to set the `withdrawRoyalty`. This means it could update the `withdrawRoyalty` to a higher value than intended by the system and call the `distribute()` function for a `credId` in the same batch transaction. This could be used to always steal the royalty fees at a higher rate.

5. **Cred**
   - **Contract owner** - The owner has the ability to pause/unpause the contract at any time. It also has access to core functions `setPhiSignerAddress()`, `setProtocolFeeDestination()`, `setProtocolFeePercent()`, `setPhiRewardsAddress()`, `addToWhitelist()`, `removeFromWhitelist()` and finally to upgrade the contract itself. Most of these powers carry the risk as mentioned in the PhiFactory owner section above. But the most important point to note is the ability for `protocol fee percent + creatorFee percent` (i.e., `buyShareRoyalty`/`sellShareRoyalty`) to be greater than 10000 (in basis points). Due to this, we could underflow in function `_handleTrade()` [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L624) since the `protocolFee` and `creatorFee` summation would be greater than the price. This would prevent selling shares of all `credIds` and turn the contract into a honeypot. Consider ensuring in the setter function `setProtocolFeePercent()` that it is not greater than `MAX_ROYALTY_RANGE` of 5000, which is the max for setting creator fee buy share and sell share royalties when creating a cred. 

   - **`phiSignerAddress`** - Holds the power to allow/disallow cred creations and updates. It does not pose a significant risk in the `updateCred()` function but can when creating a cred with incorrect data [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-phi/blob/8c0985f7a10b231f916a51af5d506dd6b0c54120/src/Cred.sol#L253). 
   - **`protocolFeeDestination`** - Can revert (if a contract) in its fallback function when fees are paid out to it through function `_handleTrade()`.

6. **BondingCurve**
   - **Contract owner** - Owner has power to change cred contract variable to manipulate protocol fee percents and creator royalties (`buyShareRoyalty`/`sellShareRoyalty`) for creds that are currently being dynamically retrieved from Cred.sol.

## Non-Critical issues

## [NC-01] Remove redundant console2 foundry imports

The console2 imports seem to be have been used for testing but have not been removed. Consider removing it since they do not serve any use in production. 

```solidity
File: CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol
12: import { console2 } from "forge-std/console2.sol"; 

File: BondingCurve.sol
8: import { console2 } from "forge-std/console2.sol"; 
```

## [NC-02] No function to update cred contract in CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol

In the CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol contract, there are only two functions which allow the owner to update the phi rewards contract and withdraw royalty. But there is no function to update the cred contract.

Although the cred implementation contract is upgradeable, if the proxy-implementation cred contracts itself need to be changed while keeping the distributor contracts the same, there won't be a way to update the cred contract address in CuratorRewardsDistributor.

```solidity
File: CuratorRewardsDistributor.sol
51:     function updatePhiRewardsContract(address phiRewardsContract_) external onlyOwner {
52:         if (phiRewardsContract_ == address(0)) {
53:             revert InvalidAddressZero();
54:         }
55:         phiRewardsContract = IPhiRewards(phiRewardsContract_);
56:         emit PhiRewardsContractUpdated(phiRewardsContract_);
57:     }
58: 
59:     function updateRoyalty(uint256 newRoyalty_) external onlyOwner {
60:         if (newRoyalty_ > MAX_ROYALTY_RANGE) {
61:             revert InvalidRoyalty(newRoyalty_);
62:         }
63:         withdrawRoyalty = newRoyalty_;
64:         emit RoyaltyUpdated(newRoyalty_);
65:     }
```

## [NC-03] Remove redundant ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable inheritance 

The ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable `nonReentrant` is not used in PhiNFT1155.sol contract. Consider removing the inheritance. 

```solidity
File: PhiNFT1155.sol
21: contract PhiNFT1155 is
22:     Initializable,
23:     UUPSUpgradeable,
24:     ERC1155SupplyUpgradeable,
25:     ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, 
```

## [NC-04] Remove redundant `protocolFeeDestination()` call

The below code is present in the `initialize()` function in the PhiNFT1155.sol contract. This function call to retrieve the `protocolFeeDestination` is not necessary since it is already supplied as a parameter to the `initialize()` function.

Since initializations only occur from the phiFactoryContract, the parameter would represent the latest `protocolFeeDestination`. 

```solidity
File: PhiNFT1155.sol
122:         protocolFeeDestination = phiFactoryContract.protocolFeeDestination();
```

## [NC-05] Consider reverting with a reason instead of running into underflow error

The function `createArtFromFactory()` is called when an `artId` is being created through the phiFactory contract. The issue is that if enough `msg.value` is not supplied to cover `artFee`, we revert with an underflow error. 

It would be better to revert with a reason, e.g., error `NotEnoughFees()`.

```solidity
File: PhiNFT1155.sol
139:     function createArtFromFactory(uint256 artId_) external payable onlyPhiFactory whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
140:         
154:         ...

155:         if ((msg.value - artFee) > 0) {
156:            
157:          
158:             _msgSender().safeTransferETH(msg.value - artFee);
159:         }
160: 
161:         return createdTokenId;
162:     }
```

## [NC-06] Consider removing redundant conditions from functions `safeTransferFrom()` and `safeBatchTransferFrom()` in PhiNFT1155.sol contract

Remove first condition `from_ != address(0)` from checks below since it is already checked in the internal function calls. 

```solidity
File: PhiNFT1155.sol
318:     function safeTransferFrom(
319:         address from_,
320:         address to_,
321:         uint256 id_,
322:         uint256 value_,
323:         bytes memory data_
324:     )
325:         public
326:         override
327:     {   
328:         
329:         if (from_ != address(0) && soulBounded(id_)) revert TokenNotTransferable();
330:         address sender = _msgSender();
331:         ...
336:     }
337: 
338:  
344:     function safeBatchTransferFrom(
345:         address from_,
346:         address to_,
347:         uint256[] memory ids_,
348:         uint256[] memory values_,
349:         bytes memory data_
350:     )
351:         public
352:         override
353:     {
354:        
355:         for (uint256 i; i < ids_.length; i++) {
356:             if (from_ != address(0) && soulBounded(ids_[i])) revert TokenNotTransferable();
357:         }
358:         ...
363:     }
```

## [NC-07] Consider using an array of comments for function `depositBatch()`

The function `depositBatch()` does not allow each deposit to have a separate comment. Consider passing a comments array as well. There does not seem to be a problem with the current contracts in-scope but support can be extended if the function is used in future contract integrations. 

```solidity
File: RewardControl.sol
56:     function depositBatch(
57:         address[] calldata recipients,
58:         uint256[] calldata amounts,
59:         bytes4[] calldata reasons,
60:         string calldata comment
61:     )
62:         external
63:         payable
64:     {
```

## [NC-08] Consider removing redundant function `withdraw()` from PhiFactory.sol

The function `withdraw()` is not required since the protocol fees are currently sent to the `protocolFeeDestination` correctly.

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
830:     function `withdraw()` external onlyOwner {
831:         protocolFeeDestination.safeTransferETH(address(this).balance);
832:     }
```

## [NC-09] Remove TODOs from the code

The `artId` check mentioned by the TODO comment on Line 583 has already been implemented, consider removing it.

```solidity
File: PhiFactory.sol
581:     function createERC1155Internal(uint256 newArtId, ERC1155Data memory createData_) internal returns (address) {
582:        
583:         // Todo check if artid exists, if artid exists, reverts
```

## [NC-10] Price limits array should be checked for equal length

In the `_validateAndCalculateBatch()` function, we check the `credIds_` and `amounts_` arrays to be of equal length but this is not done for `priceLimits_` as well.

```solidity
File: Cred.sol
832:     function _validateAndCalculateBatch(
833:         uint256[] calldata credIds_,
834:         uint256[] calldata amounts_,
835:         uint256[] calldata priceLimits_,
836:         bool isBuy
837:     )
838:         internal
839:         view
840:         returns (
841:             uint256 totalAmount,
842:             uint256[] memory prices,
843:             uint256[] memory protocolFees,
844:             uint256[] memory creatorFees
845:         )
846:     {
847:        
848:         uint256 length = credIds_.length;
849:         if (length != amounts_.length) {
850:             revert InvalidArrayLength();
851:         }
```
